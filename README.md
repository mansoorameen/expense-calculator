# expense-calculator

Coding a personal expense calculator using js.

Features:
*Included placeholder for input fields i.e, amount spent and on what(description)
*Adding items and/or removing items works and shows exact total amount for any moment.
*Input fields clear automatically after each entry, thus making it easier to input second entry without having to manually clear :)

Please add your version of ideas in a separate branch, NOT IN MASTER :)
Happy coding..
